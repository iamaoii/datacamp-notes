# ðŸ“š DataCamp Learning Notes & Code Archive

Welcome to my **DataCamp Notes & Code Repository** â€” a personal collection of what Iâ€™ve learned, built, and practiced while studying through various DataCamp courses.

This repo serves as both a **reference** for myself and a way to **track my progress** through the different skill and career tracks I've explored. It includes **course notes**, **practice code**, and **mini-projects** that demonstrate the concepts I've learned along the way.

## ðŸ“ˆ Progress & Reflection

Learning through DataCamp has been an exciting and continuous journey.  
As I move through each course, I take time to reflect on the concepts, document what Iâ€™ve learned, and apply it through code.

This repository evolves alongside my growth â€” with new folders, cleaner code, and deeper insights added regularly.  
Itâ€™s more than just notes; itâ€™s a timeline of how far Iâ€™ve come and where Iâ€™m headed in my data science journey.
